## Custom structures
If you want to add your own structures this is very easy to do,
simply create the structure, and add it to the structures folder.
The name of the paramater will be the main folder of the structure,
so say you add a python structure like this:

Your command to create this structure would be

```cmd
Create pythonStructure yourProjectName
```
